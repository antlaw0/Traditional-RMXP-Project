\t\t\t\t\bRIDDLES\b\n\n

\sh\c[#0]The Party approaches a bridge guarded by humongous troll with equally sized two-handed troll maul. The party stops short of the bridge.  After some time, the troll looks on and shouts 'SEND FORTH YOUR BEST RIDDLER!'\n\n

There is heated argument about who is the best riddler among the players...\p\t\n\n\n

'I should go!'... 'I have the best intelligence' etc... \n\n

Finally one of the players marches up to the troll. 'I'm the best riddler!' he announces brightly.\n\n

The troll splats him dead. 'I hate riddlers.'\n\n
