\b\oThe Freezer Trick:\o\n 
Only to be attempted by desperate crazy people...\b\n\n\n

\b1.\b - Take 1 ziplock bag\n\n

\b2.\b - Add 1 non functioning hard drive (preferably warm from recent use)\n\n

\b3.\b - Remove vodka from freezer\n\n

\b4.\b - Place hard drive in bag end up in the now empty icy cold freezer\n\n

\b5.\b - Close freezer door hard enough to ensure drive falls\n\n

\b6.\b - Drink just enough Vodka to not care about the drive anymore but not enough to care too much (if you end up telling the drive how much you really love it then you have probably had too much Vodka)\n\n

\b7.\b - Having partaken of just the right amount of Vodka remove drive from freezer and ziplock bag\n\n

\b8.\b - Ensure the drive has not absorbed any moisture and quickly plug it into your waiting computer\n\n

\b9.\b - Boot up (not off the same drive, see too much Vodka above)\n\n

\b10.\b - Rip all important data off the drive as quickly as your Vodka numbed fingers will allow\n\n

\b11.\b - Having salvaged your data remove the drive and throw it in the bin (\ithe dead one not the new one, again too much Vodka\i)\n\n

Now having done all of the above you can and probably should finish the Vodka.\n\n

Feel free to substitute Vodka for intoxicant of your choice, the colder the better.\n\n

Also feel free to rip drive apart after having salvaged your data the disc inside is really shiny and pretty especially after sufficiant amounts of the aforementioned favorite intoxicant.\n\n
