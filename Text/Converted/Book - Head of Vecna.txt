\tMany years ago, (back when we all were still playing D&D), I ran a game where I pitted two groups against each other. Several members of Group One came up with the idea of luring Group Two into a trap.\n\n

\tYou remember the Hand of Vecna and the Eye of Vecna that were artifacts in the old D&D world where if you cut off your hand (or your eye) and replaced it with the Hand of Vecna (or the Eye) you'd get new awesome powers?\n\n

\tWell, Group One thought up the Head of Vecna. Group One spread rumors all over the countryside (even paying Bards to spread the word about this artifact rumored to exist nearby). They even went so far as to get a real head and place it under some weak traps to help with the illusion.\n\n

\tUnfortunately, they forgot to let ALL the members of their group in on the secret plan. A Druid in Group One heard about this new artifact and went off in search of it himself (I believe to help prove himself to the party members).\n\n

\tWell, after much trial and tribulation, he found it; deactivated (or set off) all the traps; and took his "prize" off into the woods for examination. He discovered that it did not radiate magic (a well known trait of artifacts) and smiled gleefully.\n\n

\tI wasn't really worried since he was alone and I knew that there was no way he could CUT HIS OWN HEAD OFF. Alas I was mistaken as the Druid promptly summoned some carnivorous apes and instructed them to use his own scimitar and cut his head off (and of course quickly replace it with the Head of Vecna).\n\n

\tSome time later, Group One decided to find the Druid and to check on the trap. They found the headless body (and the two heads) and realized that they had errored in the plan (besides laughing at the character who played the Druid). The Head of Vecna still had BOTH eyes!\n\n

\tThey corrected this mistake and reset their traps and the Head for it's real intended victims. Group Two, by this time, had heard of the powerful artifact and decided that it bore investigating since, if true, they could use it to destroy Group One.\n\n

\tAfter much trial and tribulation, they found the resting place of the Head of Vecna! They were particularly impressed with the cunning traps surrounding the site (one almost missed his save against the weakest poison known to man). They recovered the Head and made off to a safe area. Group Two actually CAME TO BLOWS (several rounds of fighting) after each other arguing over WHO WOULD GET THEIR HEAD CUT OFF!\n\n

\tSeveral greedy players had to be hurt and restrained before it was decided who would be the recipient of the great powers bestowed by the Head. The magician was selected and one of them promptly cut his head off. As the players were lifting the Head of Vecna to place it on it's new body, another argument broke out and they spent several minutes shouting and yelling. Then, finally, they put the Head onto the character.\n\n

\tWell, of course, the Head simply fell off the lifeless body. All members of Group Two began yelling and screaming at each other (and at me) and then, on their own, decided that they had let too much time pass between cutting off the head of a hopeful recipient and put the Head of Vecna onto the body. SO THEY DID IT AGAIN!... (killing yet another player-character).\n\n

\tIn closing, it should be said that I never even cracked a smile as all this was going on. After the second PC was slaughtered, I had to give in (my side was hurting)... And Group Two blamed ME for all of that...\n\n

\tSo let that be a warning to you - don't let your head get cut off unless you really know what you're doing.\n\n
