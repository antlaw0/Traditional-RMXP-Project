"7\t\t\tConsole Role Playing Game Cliches\c\s\b\n\n
"
"¾\iThere are few people who love a good console RPG more than I. Games like Final Fantasy, Grandia, and Skies of Arcadia set a standard of majesty and wonder and immersion that American game designers are challenged to match. And yet, as I play the latest masterpiece to come out of Japan I sometimes can't help the feeling that, somehow, I've seen it all before...\i \bWARNING! There are spoilers in here for many popular CRPGs. I mean, duh.\b\p
"
"
"
"\bSleepyhead Rule\b\n
"¿The teenaged male lead will begin the first day of the game by oversleeping, being woken up by his mother, and being reminded that he's slept in so late he missed meeting his girlfriend.\n\n
"
"-\b"No! My beloved peasant village!"\b\n
"°The hero's home town, city, slum, or planet will usually be annihilated in a spectacular fashion before the end of the game, and often before the end of the opening scene.\n\n
"
"8\bThinking With The Wrong Head (\iHiro Rule\i)\b\n
"¨No matter what she's accused of doing or how mysterious her origins are, the hero will always be ready to fight to the death for any girl he met three seconds ago.\n\n
"
"%\bCubic Zirconium Corollary\b\n
"—The aforementioned mysterious girl will be wearing a pendant that will ultimately prove to be the key to either saving the world or destroying it.\n\n
"
"\bLogan's Run Rule\b\n
"RPG characters are young. Very young. The average age seems to be 15, unless the character is a decorated and battle-hardened soldier, in which case he might even be as old as 18. Such teenagers often have skills with multiple weapons and magic, years of experience, and never ever worry about their parents telling them to come home from adventuring before bedtime. By contrast, characters more than twenty-two years old will cheerfully refer to themselves as washed-up old fogies and be eager to make room for the younger generation.\n\n
"
"\bSingle Parent Rule\b\n
"ÂRPG characters with two living parents are almost unheard of. As a general rule, male characters will only have a mother, and female characters will only have a father. The missing parent either vanished mysteriously and traumatically several years ago or is never referred to at all. Frequently the main character's surviving parent will also meet an awkward end just after the story begins, thus freeing him of inconvenient filial obligations.\n\n
"
" \bSome Call Me... Tim?\b\n
"Good guys will only have first names, and bad guys will only have last names. Any bad guy who only has a first name will become a good guy at some point in the game. Good guys' last names may be mentioned in the manual but they will never be referred to in the story.\n\n
"
"\bNominal Rule\b\n
"ÇAny character who actually has a name is important in some way and must be sought out. However, if you are referred to as a part of a posessive noun (\i"Crono's Mom"\i) then you are superfluous.\n\n
"
"\bThe Compulsories\b\n
"ßThere's always a fire dungeon, an ice dungeon, a sewer maze, a misty forest, a derelict ghost ship, a mine, a glowing crystal maze, an ancient temple full of traps, a magic floating castle, and a technological dungeon.\n\n
"
"4\bLuddite Rule (\ior, George Lucas Rule\i)\b\n
"jSpeaking of which, technology is inherently evil and is the exclusive province of the Bad Guys. They're the ones with the robots, factories, cyberpunk megalopolises and floating battle stations, while the Good Guys live in small villages in peaceful harmony with nature. (\iAlthough somehow your guns and/or heavily armed airships are exempted from this.\i)\n\n
"
"?\bLet's Start From The Very Beginning (\iYuna Rule\i)\b\n
"Whenever there is a sequel to an RPG that features the same main character as the previous game, that character will always start with beginner skills. Everything that they learned in the previous game will be gone, as will all their ultra-powerful weapons and equipment.\p
"
"1\bPoor Little Rich Hero (\iMeis Rule\i)\b\n
"šIf the hero comes from a rich and powerful family, it will have fallen on hard times and be broke and destitute by the time the game actually starts.\n\n
"
"C\bThe Higher The Hair, The Closer To God (\iCloud Rule\i)\b\n
"aThe more outrageous his hairstyle, the more important a male character is to the story.\n\n
"
"\bGarrett's Principle\b\n
"áLet's not mince words: you're a thief. You can walk into just about anybody's house like the door wasn't even locked. You just barge right in and start looking for stuff. Anything you can find that's not nailed down is yours to keep. You will often walk into perfect strangers' houses, lift their precious artifacts, and then chat with them like you were old neighbors as you head back out with their family heirlooms under your arm. Unfortunately, this never works in stores.\n\n
"
"\bHey, I Know You!\b\n
"MYou will accumulate at least three of these obligatory party members:\n
"k* The spunky princess who is rebelling\n\tagainst her royal parent and is in love\n\twith the hero.\n
"§* The demure, soft-spoken female mage\n\tand healing magic specialist who is not\n\tonly in love with the hero, but is also\n\tthe last survivor of an ancient race.\n
"n* The tough-as-nails female warrior who is\n\tnot in love with the hero (\inote that this\n\tis the only female character in the\n\tgame who is not in love with the hero\n\tand will therefore be indicated as such\n\tby having a spectacular scar, a missing\n\teye, cyborg limbs or some other physical\n\tdeformity -- see The Good, The Bad,\n\tAnd The Ugly Rule.\i)\n
"R* The achingly beautiful gothy swordsman\n\twho is riven by inner tragedy.\n
"H* The big, tough, angry guy who, deep\n\tdown, is a total softy.\n
"O* The hero's best friend, who is actually\n\tmuch cooler than the hero.\n
"~* The grim, selfish mercenary who over\n\tthe course of the game learns what it\n\tmeans to really care about other people.\n
"‚* The character who is actually a spy for\n\tthe bad guys but will instantly switch\n\tto your side when you find out about it.\n
"Ë* The weird bonus character who requires\n\ta bizarre series of side quests to make\n\tthem effective (\iwith the ultimate result\n\tthat no player ever uses this character if\n\tit can be avoided.\i)\n
"J* The nauseatingly cute mascot\n\twho is useless in all battles.\n\n
"
"!\bHey, I Know You, Too!\b\n
"_You will also confront/be confronted by at least three of these obligatory antagonists:\n
"* The amazingly good-looking and amazingly\n\tevil long-haired prettyboy who may or\n\tmay not be the ultimate villain.\n
"* The villain's loyal right-hand man,\n\twho comes in two versions: humorously\n\tincompetent or annoyingly persistent.\n
"É* The villain's attractive female henchman,\n\twho is the strongest and most competent\n\tsoldier in the army but always lets the\n\tparty escape because she's, yes, fallen\n\tin love with the hero.\n
"

"lFurthermore, expect to encounter most of the following obligatory non-player chararcters (\iNPCs\i):\n
"
"-* The townsperson or crewmember who\n\t
"Owanders aimlessly in circles and never quite\n\tgets where he is going.\n
":* Hilariously incompetent or cowardly\n\tsoldiers.\n
"º* The NPC who has a crush on another\n\tNPC and can't quite work up the nerve\n\tto tell him or her, so instead tells every\n\tother person who wanders by about it\n\tat great length.\n
"=* A group of small children playing\n\thide-and-seek.\n
"6* The wise and noble captain/king/high priest.\n
"‚* The wise and noble captain/king/high\n\tpriest's splutteringly evil second-in-\n\tcommand. Nobody, including the hero, will\n\t
".notice the second's constant, crazed\n\t
"Wscheming until the moment when he\n\tbetrays everyone to the forces of badness.\n
",* The NPC who is obsessed with his\n\t
"[completely mundane job and witters on\n\tendlessly about how great it is. He's so\n\t
"7thrilled by it that he wants to share it with\n\t
"^everyone he sees, so given a quarter of a\n\tchance he'll make you do his job for him.\n
"
"c* The (\iadult\i) NPC who has nothing better\n\tto do than play kids' games with passersby.\n
"{* The group of young women who have\n\tformed a scarily obsessive fan club for\n\tone of your female party members.\p
"
"\bCrono's Complaint\b\n
"—The less the main character talks, the more words are put into his mouth, and therefore the more trouble he gets into through no fault of his own.\n\n
"
"=\b"Silly Squall, bringing a sword to a gunfight..."\b\n
"‚No matter what timeframe the game is set in -- past, present, or future -- the main hero and his antagonist will both use a sword for a weapon. (\iTherefore, you can identify your antagonist pretty easily right from the start of the game just by looking for the other guy who uses a sword.\i) These swords will be far more powerful than any gun and often capable of distance attacks.\p
"
"(\bJust Nod Your Head And Smile\b\n
"rAnd no matter how big that big-ass sword is, you won't stand out in a crowd. Nobody ever crosses the street to avoid you or seems to be especially shocked or alarmed when a heavily armed gang bursts into their house during dinner, rummages through their posessions, and demands to know if they've seen a black-caped man. People can get used to anything, apparently.\n\n
"
"\bAeris's Corollary\b\n
"œJust as the main male character will always use a sword or a variant of a sword, the main female character will always use a rod or a staff of some sort.\p
"
"\bMacGyver Rule\b\n
"Other than for the protagonists, your choice of weapons is not limited to the prosaic guns, clubs, or swords. Given appropriate skills, you can cut a bloody swath across the continent using gloves, combs, umbrellas, megaphones, dictionaries, sketching tablets -- you name it, you can kill with it. Even better, no matter how surreal your choice of armament, every store you pass will just happen to stock an even better model of it for a very reasonable price. Who else is running around the world killing people with an umbrella?\n\n
"
"9\bO Brother, Where Art Thou? (\iMelfice Rule\i)\b\n
"òIf the male hero has an older sibling, the sibling will also be male and will turn out to be one of the major villains. If the hero has a younger sibling, the sibling will be female and will be kidnapped and held hostage by the villains.\n\n
"
"*\bCapitalism Is A Harsh Mistress\b\n
"ŠOnce you sell something to a shopkeeper, he instantly sells it to somebody else and you will never see the item again no matter what.\n\n
"
"/\bDimensional Transcendence Principle\b\n
" Buildings are much, much larger on the inside than on the outside, and that doesn't even count the secret maze of tunnels behind the clock in the basement.\n\n
"
"\bLocal Control Rule\b\n
"Although the boss monster terrorizing the first city in the game is less powerful than the non-boss monsters that are only casual nuisances to cities later in the game, nobody from the first city ever thinks of hiring a few mercenaries from the later cities to kill the monster.\n\n
"
"\bNostradamus Rule\b\n
"All legends are 100% accurate. All rumors are entirely factual. All prophecies will come true, and not just someday but almost immediately.\n\n
"
"\bIDKFA\b\n
"¦The basic ammunition for any firearms your characters have is either unlimited or very, very easy to obtain. This will apply even if firearms are extremely rare.\n\n
"
"&\bIndestructible Weapon Rule\b\n
"üNo matter how many times you use that sword to strike armored targets or fire that gun on full auto mode it will never break, jam or need any form of maintenance unless it is critical to the story that the weapon breaks, jams or needs maintenance.\n\n
"
"\bSelective Paralysis\b\n
"jYour characters must always keep both feet on the ground and will be unable to climb over low rock ledges, railings, chairs, cats, slightly differently-colored ground, or any other trivial objects which may happen to be in their way. Note that this condition will not prevent your characters from jumping from railroad car to railroad car later in the game.\n\n
"
"\bBed Bed Bed\b\n
"uA good night's sleep will cure all wounds, diseases, and disabilities, up to and including death in battle.\n\n
"
"7\bYou Can't Kill Me, I Quit (\iSeifer Rule\i)\b\n
"tThe good guys never seem to get the hang of actually arresting or killing the bad guys. Minor villains are always permitted to go free so they can rest up and menace you again later -- sometimes five minutes later. Knowing this rule, you can deduce that if you do manage to kill (\ior force the surrender of\i) a bad guy, you must be getting near the end of the game.\n\n
"
"9\bAnd Now You Die, Mr. Bond! (\iBeatrix Rule\i)\b\n
"¥Fortunately for you, the previous rule also applies in reverse. Rather than kill you when they have you at their mercy, the villains will settle for merely blasting you down to 1 hit point and leaving you in a crumpled heap while they stroll off, laughing. (\iThis is, of course, because they're already planning ahead how they'll manipulate you into doing their bidding later in the game -- see Way To Go, Serge.\i)\n\n
"
"\bZap!\b\n
"ÍMost villains in RPGs possess some form of teleportation. They generally use it to materialize in front of the adventurers when they reach the Obligatory Legendary Relic Room and seize the goodies just before you can. The question "if the bad guy can teleport anywhere at any time, then why doesn't (\is\i)he just zip in, grab the artifact, and leave before the adventurers have even finished the nerve-wracking puzzle on the third floor?" is never answered.\p
"
"8\bHeads I Win, Tails You Lose (\iGrahf Rule\i)\b\n
"¿It doesn't matter that you won the fight with the boss monster; the evil task he was trying to carry out will still get accomplished somehow. Really, you might as well not have bothered.\n\n
"
"#\bClockwork Universe Rule\b\n
"`No matter how hard you try to stop it, that comet or meteor will always hit the earth.\n\n
"
"\bFake Ending\b\n
"œThere will be a sequence which pretends to be the end of the game but obviously isn't -- if for no other reason than because you're still on Disk 1 of 4.\p
"
"/\bYou Die, And We All Move Up In Rank\b\n
"äDuring that fake ending, the true villain of the story will kill the guy you'd thought was the villain, just to demonstrate what a badass he (\ithe true villain\i) really is. You never get to kill the fake villain yourself.\n\n
"
"8\b"What are we going to do tonight, Vinsfeld?"\b\n
"$The goal of every game (\ias revealed during the Fake Ending\i) is to Save the World from an evil figure who's trying to take it over or destroy it. There is no way to escape from this formidable task. No matter whether the protagonist's goal in life is to pay off a debt, to explore distant lands, or just to make time with that cute girl in the blue dress, it will be necessary for him to Save the World in order to accomplish it. Take heart, though -- once the world gets sorted out, everything else will fall into place almost immediately.\n\n
"
"\bZelda's Axiom\b\n
"ÞWhenever somebody tells you about "the five ancient talismans" or "the nine legendary crystals" or whatever, you can be quite confident that Saving the World will require you to go out and find every last one of them.\n\n

"
"\bFodor's Guide Rule\b\n
"mIn the course of your adventure you will visit one desert city, one port town, one mining town, one casino city, one magic city (\iusually flying\i), one medieval castle kingdom, one clockwork city, one martial arts-based community, one thieves' slum, one lost city and one sci-fi utopia. On the way you'll also get a chance to see the cave with rocks that glow from a natural energy source, the village populated with nonhuman characters, the peaceful village where everyone knows the latest news about the hero's quest (\isee Guy in the Street Rule\i), the snow village, the magical forest/lake/mountain, the shop in the middle of nowhere, the fantastic-looking place with lots of FMVs just showing your entrance, the subtropical jungle island populated by friendly natives, the annoying cavern maze, and a place -- any place -- that was destroyed in some past disaster.\n\n

"ˆOne of your antagonists will have three lovably incompetent stooges whom you fight over and over again. Although they're trusted with their boss's most important plans and equipment, they will screw up repeatedly, argue incessantly among themselves, blab secret information, and generally only come out victorious when their job was to be a diversion or a delaying tactic. A high point of the game will come when the True Villain reveals himself and you're able to convince the stooges you're all on the same side. They won't help you out any more successfully than they helped the antagonist, but at least you won't have to fight them any more.\p
"
"\bThousand Year Rule\b\n
"The Ancient Evil returns to savage the land every thousand years on the dot, and the last time it showed up was just about 999.9875 years ago. Despite their best efforts, heroes of the past were never able to do more than seal the Evil away again for the future to deal with (\iwhich brings up the question of just how exactly does this "sealing away" work anyway, but never mind.\i) The good news is that this time, the Evil will get destroyed permanently. The bad news is that you're the one who's going to have to do it.\n\n
"
"-\bPrinciple of Narrative Efficiency\b\n
"If the main villain (\ior the enemy you've been trying to kill for most of the game before he summons the real final villain\i) was ever defeated in the past by another group of adventurers, one of them will secretly be in your party and one of them will be the hero's father.\n\n

"°Outside the major cities, there is no government whatsoever. Of course, perhaps that explains why it's so difficult and dangerous to get anywhere outside the major cities.\n\n
"
"\bFirst Law of Travel\b\n
"SAnything can become a vehicle -- castles, cities, military academies, you name it -- so do not be alarmed when the stones of the ancient fortress you are visiting shake underfoot and the whole thing lifts off into the sky. As a corollary, anything is capable of flight if it would be cool, aeronautics or even basic physics be damned.\n\n
"
" \bSecond Law of Travel\b\n
"ùThere will be only one of any non-trivial type of vehicle in the entire world. Thus, only one ocean-capable steamboat, only one airship, and so forth. Massive facilities will have been constructed all over the world to service this one vehicle.\n\n
"
"\bThird Law of Travel\b\n
"½The only way to travel by land between different areas of a continent will always be through a single narrow pass in a range of otherwise impenetrable mountains. Usually a palace or monastery will have been constructed in the pass, entirely filling it, so that all intracontinental traffic is apparently required to abandon their vehicles and go on foot up stairs and through the barracks, library and throne room to get to the other side. This may explain why most people just stay home. (\iIn some cases a cave or underground tunnel may be substituted for the palace or monastery, but it will still be just as inconvenient with the added bonuses of cave-ins and nonsensical elevator puzzles.\i)\n\n
"

"
"\bSixth Law of Travel\b\n
"Nobody gets to own a cooler ride than you. If you ever do see a cooler vehicle than the one you've got now, at some point before the end of the game you will either take over this vehicle, get something even bigger and better, or else see it destroyed in a glorious blaze.\n\n

"
"1\bLast Law of Travel (\iBig Joe Rule\i)\b\n
"RAs has been described, you must endure great trials just to get from town to town: locating different vehicles, operating ancient transport mechanisms, evading military blockades, the list goes on. But that's just you. Every other character in the game seems to have no trouble getting to any place in the world on a moment's notice.\n\n
"
"C\bIf You Meet The Buddha In A Random Encounter, Kill Him!\b\n
"When you're out wandering around the world, you must kill everything you meet. People, animals, plants, insects, fire hydrants, small cottages, anything and everything is just plain out to get you. It may be because of your rampant kleptomania (\isee Garrett's Principle.\i)\n\n
"
"\bLaw of Numbers\b\n
"$There will be several items or effects which depend on the numerical value of your hit points, level, etc., which makes no sense unless the characters can see all the numbers in their world and find it perfectly normal that a spell only works on a monster whose level is a multiple of 5.\n\n
"
"&\bMagical Inequality Theorem\b\n
"øIn the course of your travels you may find useful-sounding spells such as Petrify, Silence, and Instant Death. However, you will end up never using these spells in combat because a\i) all ordinary enemies can be killed with a few normal attacks, making fancy attacks unneccessary, b\i) all bosses and other stronger-than-average monsters are immune to those effects so there's no point in using them for long fights where they'd actually come in handy, and c\i) the spells usually don't work anyway.\n\n

"pThe final villain's grand scheme will have involved the deaths of thousands or even millions of innocent people, the clever manipulation of governments, armies, and entire populations, and will have taken anywhere from five to five thousand years to come to fruition. The hero will come up with a method of undoing this plan forever in less than five minutes.\n\n\n\n

"\bPyrrhic Victory\b\n
"By the time you've gotten it in gear, dealt with your miscellaneous personal crises and are finally ready to go Save the World once and for all, nine-tenths of it will already have been destroyed. Still, you've got to give your all to save the remaining one-tenth.\n\n

"5\bPoetic Villain Principle (\iKefka Rule\i)\b\n
"½All villains will suddenly become poets, philisophers, and/or dramatic actors when a\i) they first meet the hero, b\i) they are about to win or their evil plan is finally ready, c\i) some major event in the game is about to begin, d\i) right before the final battle, and e\i) right before they die, when they will frequently be feeling generous enough to reward you with some homespun wisdom about making the most of life while you have it.\n\n
"
"\bCompression of Time\b\n
"As you approach the final confrontation with the villain, events will become increasingly awkward, contrived and disconnected from one another -- almost as if some cosmic Author was running up against a deadline and had to slap together the ending at the last minute.\n\n

" \bAdam Smith's Revenge\b\n
" By the end of the game you are renowned everywhere as the Legendary Heroes, every surviving government and authority figure has rallied behind you, the fate of the world is obviously hanging in the balance, and out of nowhere random passers-by give you a pat on the back and heartfelt good luck wishes. However, shopkeepers won't even give you a discount, much less free supplies for the final battle with evil.\n\n
"
""\bAdam Smith's Corollary\b\n
"No matter how thoroughly devastated the continent/planet/universe is, there's always some shopkeeper who survived the end of the world and sits outside the gates of the villain's castle, selling the most powerful equipment in the game, like nothing ever happened.\n\n
"
"$\bThe Long Arm of the Plot\b\n
"©Any bad guys, no matter how far they run, will always end up in one of two ways by the end of the game: obviously dead, or on your side. There is no in-between.\n\n\n\n
"
"#\bApocalypse Any Time Now\b\n
"ˆThe best time to do side quests is while the huge meteor hovers in the sky above the planet, waiting to fall and destroy the world.\n\n

"5\b"So, Andross, you reveal your true form!"\b\n
"ùYou will have to kill the evil villain at least twice at the end of the game. First the villain will look like a person or some creature and be rather easy to kill. Then he will grow to about 50 times the hero's size and be much harder to kill.\n\n
"
" \bIn Your Face, Jesus!\b\n
"æEven if you manage to deal with him that time, you're not done -- the villain will then transform into his final form, which is always an angelic winged figure with background music remixed for ecstatic chorus and pipe organ.\n\n

"5\bThe Moral Of The Story (\iGhaleon Rule\i)\b\n
"|Every problem in the universe can be solved by finding the right long-haired prettyboy and beating the crap out of him.\n\n
"
"\bWeapon Rule\b\n
"ÔThere's always a hidden creature who is much harder to defeat than even the ultimate bad guy's final, world-annihilating form. It's lucky for all concerned that this hidden creature prefers to stay hidden rather than trying to take over the world himself, because he'd probably win. As a corollary, whatever reward you get for killing the hidden creature is basically worthless because by the time you're powerful enough to defeat him, you don't need it any more.\n\n
"
"\bThe Ultimate Rule\b\n
"Anything called "Ultima (\iwhatever\i)" or "Ultimate (\iwhatever\i)" isn't. There's always at least one thing somewhere in the world which is even more.\n\n
