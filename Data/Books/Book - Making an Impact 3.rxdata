"!\bJust the facts, ma'am\b\n
"‘The first thing you need to do with a character is get the facts straight. Inconsistencies in characters, even something as small as saying they don't drink and later drinking a beer with the guys for no reason, can seem like a big inconsistency to players. The easiest way to set your characters straight is to create a notepad document with all of the information about the character in it. Just a little while thinking up all of your character's little personality quirks and such can breathe new life into them and make them seem more real than before. It also helps you decide, "Is this something Carol would do? Is this something Alex would say?"\n\n

"Bet it seems like a lot, huh? Don't worry, you don't have to do it all at once... you don't even have to do all of it. You can remove parts, change parts, add parts, or whatever you like. This is all just a basic blueprint for your character design template. Just like a blank template in RPG Maker 2000, you fill in all of the blanks and turn the character into who YOU want them to be. Keeping sheets like this around will help you keep your character's facts straight, and also helps you keep them in character. Speaking of which...\n\n\n

"#\bKeeping It In Character\b\n
"$It's unlikely a diehard pacifist will shoot first and ask questions later. It's also pretty unlikely that someone who loves wars and fighting would be a strong advocate for peace. When characters act 'out of character', they loose all of the personality and realism that they once had.\n\n\n

"
"\bAll Things Change\b\n
"sJust as the storyline changes from beginning to end, the characters change as well. The events and people all around them affect them, and that change is one of the most important aspects of character development. Character development isn't just something you do when you first start to write the RPG, but it's something that happens to the characters as they move from beginning to end of the story. One of the most common things is the 'coming of age' style story of a boy becoming a man, taking responsibility for himself and his actions, and learning what the real world is like. This isn't the only method of character development but it's a very common example. What happens over the course of your RPG, from beginning to end? How does your character react to these events? How are they changed from the person they were at the start to the person they were at the end?\n\n\n
